# SIMPLE-ARRAY-SUM
â€¢	This program computes the sum of an integer array. It uses utility functions (ltrim, rtrim, split) to parse input: reads array size, then elements as a space-separated string, converts to a vector. The simpleArraySum function iterates via range-based for loop to add all elements and return the total. Main outputs the result to a file.
